    "- **sub_application**: Descriptive name for a set of related Jobs, Folders or SubFolders with a same application\n",
    "- **run_as** : The OS user responsible for running a job (or all jobs in a folder or subfolder). By default, jobs are run by the user account where the Control-M/Agent is installed. To specify a diferent user, the agent must be running as root\n",
    "- **days_keep_active** : Defines the number of days to keep a job if the job did not run at its scheduled date. You can set this property for a Job, Folder, or SubFolder. Jobs in a folder are kept until the maximum DaysKeepActive value for any of the jobs in the folder has passed. This enables you to retrieve job status of all the jobs in the folder\n",
    "- **confirm** : Defines a job, folder, or subfolder that requires user confirmation\n",
    "- **created_by**: Specifies the Control‑M user responsible for job definitions. You can define this property for a Job object or Folder object\n",
    "- **description** : Description of th Job, Folder or SubFolder\n",
    "- **priority** : Defines the priority that a job has over other jobs. You can set this property for a Job, Folder, or SubFolder\n",
    "- **run_as_dummy** : (boolean) Runs any job as a dummy job\n",
    "- **retroactive_order** : (boolean) Orders a job retroactively to make up for days on which the job did not run. For example, Control-M was down for two days due to a hardware issue; as soon as jobs can run again, this job is scheduled retroactively to run an additional two times, to make up for the days that Control-M was inactive\n",
    "- **rerun** : See below `Rerun` section\n",
    "- **time_zone** : Adds the time zone to jobs, folder, or subfolder. Time zones should be defined at least 48 hours before the intended execution date. We recommend to define the same time zone for all jobs in a folder\n",
    "- **variables** : list of variables in a key, value format. See below `Variables`\n",
    "- **when** : See below `When` section\n",
    "- **if_list** : List of `If` objects. See below `If` section\n",
