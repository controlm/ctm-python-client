# Control-M Python Client

Control-M Python Client is a python library to programmatically design, schedule and run your Control-M workflows. The design of the Control-M Python Client is oriented towards data scientists and developers who prefer a more programmatic approach to workflow orchestration.

## Getting Started

The best way to get familiar is to check the [notebooks examples](https://github.com/controlm/ctm-python-client/tree/main/examples/). Start with [Hello world](https://github.com/controlm/ctm-python-client/blob/main/examples/101-HelloWorld/HelloWorld.ipynb) to get familiar with the syntax.

You do not need to have an in-depth knowledge of Control-M, but some familiarity with Control-M will help you understand the different job types and syntax offered by Control-M Python Client.

### Control-M Environment

To deploy jobs with Control-M Python client you will require:

- An accessible Control-M environment<sup>1</sup>
- Authorization to use Automation-API<sup>2</sup>
- An available Control-M Agent (required only to run jobs)

<sup>1</sup> We recommend first trying it out in a sandbox environment

<sup>2</sup> Authorizations are based on roles assigned to API Keys or Users

Check with your system administrator if you have the required environment to use Control-M Python Client

Note: Control-M Python Client does not require use of the Automation API ctm cli.

### IDE

Use any IDE you want, but Control-M Python Client is more fun to test with notebooks, so make sure that your IDE supports it. If you use VSCode, we recommend that you download/activate the Python Extension.

### Authentication

Control-M Python Client uses Control-M Automation API and requires the same authentication used in a Control-M environment. We advise you to get familiar with it, whether using [Helix Control-M](https://documents.bmc.com/supportu/controlm-saas/en-US/Documentation/Users_and_Roles.htm) or the [Control-M on premises](https://docs.bmc.com/docs/display/workloadautomation/Control-M+Workload+Automation+Documentation).

Note that Automation API allows you to programmatically create and delete authorization roles. Work with your system administrator to decide on the best way to provide authorizations for developers while satisfying your security needs.

For an example on how to create an api key with a specified lifetime, check the [create_key](https://github.com/controlm/ctm-python-client/blob/main/tools/create_key.py) tool

## Installation

We recommend that you set up a virtual environment before installing:

For Linux:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

For Windows:
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Installing via pip
You will need pip and git installed on your system before you run this command.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/controlm/ctm-python-client.git
```

### Installing from source

```
git clone https://github.com/controlm/ctm-python-client.git
pip install ctm-python-client
```

Note: You can use the library without installing, be sure to add the src folder in the python path:
```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0,"<path-to-repo>/src")
```

## Creating a flow with Control-M Python Client

Examples can be found in the example section in the format of python notebooks or as python scripts. We recommend to start with the notebooks.

### Starting a flow
To start a flow you need to import `CmJobFlow`:
``` python
from ctm_python_client.core.bmc_control_m import CmJobFlow
```
Create a flow:
```python
t1_flow = CmJobFlow(
    application="Demo", sub_application="HelloWorld", session=session, ctm_uri=ctm_uri
)
```

`ctm_uri` is your Automation API endpoint

`session` is a session object.

To create a session import `Session`:
```python
from ctm_python_client.session.session import Session
```

and create a session either for Helix Control-M:
```python
session = Session(endpoint=ctm_uri, api_key="An API KEY provided by my system administrator")
```

or for Control-M:
```python
session = Session(endpoint=ctm_uri, username="myuser", password="my password")
```


**IMPORTANT: Passwords and API Keys are sensitive information! Please handle as such. Never commit code with these!**

### Defining where and when to run

You created a flow! Now you need to define where it will run. Define the host (agent) where the flow will run and the user under which it will run.

Note: username is not necessarily your username. Rather, it is the user under which the agent is installed or the run_as user defined for the agent.

```python
t1_flow.set_run_as(username="user", host="myagent")
```

To define when the workflow should run, you need to specify the schedule. Note that workflows can be run anytime if the function .run() is called

```python
# Define the schedule
months = ["JAN", "OCT", "DEC"]
monthDays = ["ALL"]
weekDays = ["MON", "TUE", "WED", "THU", "FRI"]
fromTime = "0300"
toTime = "2100"
t1_flow.set_schedule(months, monthDays, weekDays, fromTime, toTime)
```

### Creating folders and tasks

Your flow has a name and definitions for when and where to run. But it is still empty!
Let's add a folder:

```python
f1 = t1_flow.create_folder(name="HelloWorld")
```

To create a task, you will need to import the corresponding job type. Check what are the [supported types](https://github.com/controlm/ctm-python-client/blob/main/SupportedJobs.txt)

Let's create some dummy jobs to test the flow.
First we import:
```python
from ctm_python_client.jobs.dummy import DummyJob
```
Then we create the tasks:
```python
start = t1_flow.add_job(f1, DummyJob(f1, "Start-Flow"))
end = t1_flow.add_job(f1, DummyJob(f1, "End-Flow"))
hello_world = t1_flow.add_job(f1, DummyJob(f1, "Hello-World"))
```

Now, the last thing to do to complete the flow is to set the flow by chaining tasks:

```python
# start >>  hello_world >> end
t1_flow.chain_jobs(f1, [start, hello_world, end])
```

### Check your workflow

You can view your flow in a nice diagram by importing `DisplayDAG`.

```python
from ctm_python_client.utils.displayDAG import DisplayDAG

DisplayDAG(t1_flow).display_graphviz()
```

If you are familiar with using Automation API, you can also export your workflow to Json!
```python
t1_flow.display_json()
```

### Submit the flow

Now your flow is complete! You can choose to run it or deploy it.

Deploying a flow means saving it in the database. The definitions will be stored in the Control-M Server and it will eventually run according to its schedule.

Running a job orders it immediately, regardless of the schedule. It also performs a deploy, so it will continue running according to its schedule after the initial run.

To deploy a flow:
```python
t1_flow.deploy()
```

And to run:
```python
t1_flow.run()
```
### Next Steps

Once you have successfully completed the Hello World example,take a look in the BMC Demos, they cover more advanced flows with multiple job types and Application Integrator Job types.
